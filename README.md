# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to explore how total rides, total drivers, and average fares collected by the ride-sharing organization vary based on whether the location is in an Urban city, Suburban city, or Rural city. In this analysis, we will look at visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
