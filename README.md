# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to explore how total rides, total drivers, and average fares collected by the ride-sharing organization vary based on whether the location is in an Urban city, Suburban city, or Rural city. In this analysis, we will look at visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results
### PyBer Summary DataFrame

Based on the data from the Summary DataFrame above, we can see that there are clearly more drivers in the more populated cities, so much so that the Urban located cities have 13 times as many rides as the Rural Cities and 30 times as many drivers. There are many more fares collected in heavily populated areas and the average fare per ride decreases by a whole $10 from a rural area to an urban area. The average fare per driver also decreases by around $40. Even the suburban areas have two times less rides conducted than the urban area and four times less drivers available.
